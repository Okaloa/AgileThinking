Change in an organization introduces friction just as surely as applying the brakes of a car.
A major source of friction is not just people that resist change, but more than that,
practices that do not fit together. Introducing new practices creates friction with old practices.
As an effective tool for change, the agile capabilities model helps practitioners to understand
how agile practices relate. More specifically, it helps to understand how one set of (agile) practices
creates the fertile ground for the introduction of other (agile) practices.
