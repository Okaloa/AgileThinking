‘Learning by doing’ is a commonly used phrase, with at lot of focus on ‘having fun’– but what really is having fun? And
how exactly do we make things fun apart from using all sorts of games and energizers? Inspired by
sports coaching, we will explore 3 forms of learning: free play, isolated play, and constraint-led play. We will
elaborate on the latter form, showing its effectiveness in the context of adopting new ways of working. It leads to
intrinsically motivated learners that are not only going to have more fun, but moreover, are engaged to continuously
think, learn, and adapt.
