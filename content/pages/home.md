“Give me a firm place to stand on and I will move the earth” said Archimedes as he discovered the principle behind
levers that lift objects that are too heavy to lift. Archimedes’ insight is as valid as it ever was. For people, teams
and organizations to change their ways of working often involves the type of heavy lifting that requires not just
levers but also solid foundations.

In a left-brain, analytic thinking, dominated world, the focus is on the lever provided by methods that codify new ways
of working based on past experience. As brain science teaches us, however, the left brain is a bad master; it provides
levers that are built on loose sand. Left unchecked, the left brain does not take context into account; it idealizes
solutions; and does not respond well when faced with its own limitations. Since the left brain has a hard time dealing
with change and novelty, this proves to be especially problematic for agile methods.

The agile mindset is better served by the right brain that recognizes the importance of context, looks at the whole (not
just the parts) and is better at dealing with novelty. While this kind of thinking provides a more solid foundation,
making the right brain a better master, this “whole” that “goes beyond the parts” is also notoriously hard to put into
words. The right brain is bad at verbalizing its thoughts. A mindset put into words seizes to be a mindset.

There is a need for a “whole-brain” way that covers the gap between left- and right-brain thinking. A way that both
recognizes the importance of methods and at the same time challenges it. A way that recognizes that mindset is the crucial
element and at the same time, admits that mindset cannot be grasped. A way that embraces paradox more than it polarizes.
And now that we are at it, a way that does a serious attempt at helping to deal with the paradox of **lifting oneself up by the hairs**
because that is what is required for organizations to become truly agile.

## draft

I enjoy playing golf, although I only started playing recently. It gives me a great joy when my swing hits the ball
in the right spot. More than that, being on the golf course can be deeply gratifying.  Time passes by unnoticed,
I am completely absorbed in hitting the ball, and suddenly I start hitting balls that go beyond the 200 meter mark
(which is quite far for me) with little effort.

I also enjoy working with people, teams and organizations. Just like with golf, creating change in how work is organized
can be deeply gratifying. It gives me great joy when an experience that I designed hits the right spot and creates an
"aha" moment with those that are participating in the experience. Just like with golf, the best moments are when I am
unself-concious but still fully aware of the situation and creating valuable results in the process.

Effort-less actions, and its combination of effortlessness and effectiveness is so gratifying that one cannot help but
think that this type of experience must be at the core of deep transformational change whether it be in your personal or
your professional life, on the level of individuals, on the level of teams or even on the level of organizations. The
idea of effortless action in a work context is very attractive in and by itself.

Imagine an organization in which
people negotiate complex social situations with little internal struggle, and yet perfectly in accord with the
situation. Now take this idea and scale it up to not just to a team, but to an entire organization - an organization
that can negotiate complex, changing market situations with little internal struggle in perfect accord with the
situation. 

The world is messy. The world of (organized) work is even more messy. The inevitable question that pops up is the
question of how to move from our current state of effort-full action into the state of effort-less action. If you are
like me, one of the activities that you enjoy is learning about learning, thinking about thinking, learning about
change. If so, you are fully aware that any type of change is hard especially one that involves creating joy while
realizing practical results in perfect harmony between individuals and the organization that they are in. For people,
teams and organizations to change their ways of working often involves heavy lifting that requires not just levers but
also solid foundations.

## snippets

If effort-less action is characterized with unself-counciousness, how can it be achieved? Can we make a concious effort
to achieve it? Or is it paradoxically, something that can only be learned if in some sense you already know it? Can it
be learned at all?
