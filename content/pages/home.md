“Give me a firm place to stand on and I will move the earth” said Archimedes as he discovered the principle behind
levers that lift objects that are too heavy to lift. Archimedes’ insight is as valid as it ever was. For people, teams
and organizations to change their ways of working often involves the type of heavy lifting that requires not just
levers but also solid foundations.

In a left-brain, analytic thinking, dominated world, the focus is on the lever provided by methods that codify new ways
of working based on past experience. As brain science teaches us, however, the left brain is a bad master; it provides
levers that are built on loose sand. Left unchecked, the left brain does not take context into account; it idealizes
solutions; and does not respond well when faced with its own limitations. Since the left brain has a hard time dealing
with change and novelty, this proves to be especially problematic for agile methods.

The agile mindset is better served by the right brain that recognizes the importance of context, looks at the whole (not
just the parts) and is better at dealing with novelty. While this kind of thinking provides a more solid foundation,
making the right brain a better master, this “whole” that “goes beyond the parts” is also notoriously hard to put into
words. The right brain is bad at verbalizing its thoughts. A mindset put into words seizes to be a mindset.

There is a need for a “whole-brain” way that covers the gap between left- and right-brain thinking. A way that both
recognizes the importance of methods and at the same time challenges it. A way that recognizes that mindset is the crucial
element and at the same time, admits that mindset cannot be grasped. A way that embraces paradox more than it polarizes.
And now that we are at it, a way that does a serious attempt at helping to deal with the paradox of **lifting oneself up by the hairs**
because that is what is required for organizations to become truly agile.

## draft

I enjoy playing golf, writing code, developing, teaching and coaching new ideas about new ways of working. Maybe you
enjoy swimming, cooking, painting, growing a team, starting a company, ... Since you are here, probably you enjoy
learning about new ways of working, about how indviduals think and make decisions, about how work is organized, about
how people and organizations adapt and transform (if they transform). If you are like me you may also enjoy
learnig about learning, thinking about thinking, ...

Some of the above activities can be sports or hobby activities, other activities are "professional" activities that help
earn a living, for some the distinction may not be that clear. What differentiates activities that you enjoy the most
from other activities? What makes them so deeply gratifying at occasions? My guess (and the guess of many others) is
that it is the combination of effortlessness and effectiveness. While I am completely absorbed in listening, observing
what is holding indviduals or teams back in their current way of working, ideas simply pop up in my mind that connect
with the participants in the room and catalyze new insights. Probably you have had a similar experience of effort-less
action in your personal and, hopefully, also in your professional life.

The idea of effortless action, and its combination of effortlessness and effectiveness, in a work context is very
attractive. Imagine an organization in which people negotiate complex social situations with little internal struggle,
and yet perfectly in accord with the situation. Now take this idea and scale it up to not just a team, but to an entire
organization - an organization that can negotiate complex, changing market situations with little internal struggle in
perfect accord with the situation. If this sounds to good to possibly be true, maybe it is.

The world is messy. The world of (organized) work is even more messy. The inevitable question that pops up is the
question of how to move from our current state of effort-full action into the state of effort-less action. If
effort-less action is characterized with unself-counciousness, how can it be achieved? Can we make a concious effort to
achieve it? Or is it paradoxically, something that can only be learned if in some sense you already know it? Can it
be learned at all?
