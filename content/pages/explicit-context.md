  title: Making context explicit
---

Do experienced coaches adopt/adapt practices by taking context into account? Of course they do! Do a chosen set of
principles produce a valuable, enduring outcome in every kind of context? Of course they donâ€™t!  Failure to sufficiently
take context into account is the number one factor that limits success when adopting methods. The tendency to ignore
context in our effort to simplify reality is problematic. Why then is there so little explicit guidance on the context
of applicability of principles and practices except for a call for the right culture or mindset? Context is so much more
than that. In this section we will explore a powerful notation that makes context explicit. Step, by step, we will build up
a context-based guidance for implementing practices and developing capabilities that goes beyond what most can even
dream of. The only universal principle is the principle that context always matters!
